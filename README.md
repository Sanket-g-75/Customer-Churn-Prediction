# Customer Churn Prediction Project

- The project has to be implemented using Github, DVC, MLflow to track experiments
- The dataset is a customer churn prediction with columns 'CustomerID', 'Name', 'Age', 'Gender', 'Location','Subscription_Length_Months', 'Monthly_Bill', 'Total_Usage_GB','Churn'
- As the classes are balanced, we can use general classifiers as well so will be using Random Forest Model and also using XGBoost Model
