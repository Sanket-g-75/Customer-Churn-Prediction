# Customer Churn Prediction Project

- The project has to be implemented using Github, DVC, MLflow to track experiments
- The dataset is a customer churn prediction with columns 'Call  Failure', 'Complains', 'Subscription  Length', 'Charge  Amount','Seconds of Use', 'Frequency of use', 'Frequency of SMS','Distinct Called Numbers', 'Age Group', 'Tariff Plan', 'Status', 'Age','Customer Value', 'Churn'
- Classes are imbalanced in this case, so i will have to use imputer to balance this out
